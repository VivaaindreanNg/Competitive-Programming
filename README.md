# Solutions for Competitive Programming based sites
### This repository contains list of problems solved problems for sites like EulerProject, CodeForces, etc... sites in both Java & Python. Example for EulerProject subdir:

* Java (euler/main)
* Python (euler/python)


## Running test cases (Python)
To run a particular test module under *euler/* subdir (i.e.: Run a unittest in euler/python/tests/test_xxx.py), run the following command in root of this repo:
```
$ python -m unittest euler/python/tests/test_xxx.py
```

## TODO:
- [X] Rename this repo into **Competitive-Programming**
- [X] Rename src into euler
- [ ] Create several other subfolders with to cater for HackerRank, codeforces, atCoder, etc..
